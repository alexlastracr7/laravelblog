It is the Brazilian city with the highest tourist influx and has the privilege of being the first city in South America to hold an Olympiad.This city is known as Ciudad Maravillosa (Cidade Maravilhosa in Portuguese) and it is that it elegantly combines the urban with nature, culture, history and fun.This city is established in an area that is not very conducive to the establishment of a large city due to the geographical characteristics of the area that is very limited between the mountains and the ocean. All these characteristics demanded an effort from its urban planners to design various bridges and tunnels for transit, since sometimes the width of the city is limited to no more than 10 blocks.
